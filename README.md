# Movie_Data_Analysis
**In this project, I would be performing an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of movies.**

The dataset is can be found on kaggle (https://bit.ly/3QaG1gJ)

I will be answering the following questions: 


I. Who are the actors with the most number of appearance in movies over the years


II. How did the amount of produced films changed over time?


III. Which Month had the highest number of releases over the years?


IV. What is the most & least popular movie?


V. What are the most profitbale movies and least profitable movies?


VI. What are the correlations between revenue, popularity, profit & budget?
